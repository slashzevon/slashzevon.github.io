<h1>Church of Flesh</h1>

<b>The Four Tenets of Membership:<b>
<ul>
<li>1. Belief in a higher power, Creator of our universe; provider of ultimate free will.</li>
<li>2. Love, of ourselves and then others, is the guiding force of God.</li>
<li>3. We hold authority over our flesh; no man can order us to consume anything, in any way, against our wish.</li>
<li>4. We use our God given senses, sight, touch, taste, smell, hearing, and our inner self, in order to discriminate information; NOT the words of other men, or the vehicles of technology. To do otherwise would be heresy.</li>
</ul>
